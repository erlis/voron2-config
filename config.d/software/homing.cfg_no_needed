#......Conditional Z-Hop
#      ! If the Z axis is not already homed, a full homed sequence will be run. If this is not desired, comment out the below line with !!!!!
#      The 'Safety On' line below crudely gets around the issue of a false homed state when either 'set_position_z: 0.0' or 'SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION Z=0'
#      The problem is that if either of these commands are issued, and the Z axis is not currently homed, it will now register as homed and potentially cause
#      issues with that false homed state later. Conditional flags could be set on the onset, saving which axes were already homed before using
#      'SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION Z=0' to then be followed by logic to execute M18 [AXIS that wasn't homed] to reflect the true state of things, but klipper
#      M18/M84 does not take axis flag - it's all or nothing.
